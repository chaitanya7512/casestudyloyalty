To install nginx webserver

yum install nginx -y

ansible --version
python --version
note:python is mandatory in all the clients snd server because ansible is developed in python language
now move to /etc/ansible/.This is the home directory of ansible.In this directory we see the following files
i)ansible.cnf ___ This is the ansible configuration file.
ii)hosts      ___ This is the host inventory file.In ths we can configure our clients
iii)roles
Now open the hosts inventory file
cd /etc/ansible
ls
vi hosts
[dev] //group name//
ansible_server ansible_connection=local //this is to configure the server as client//
[prod] 
ansible_amazon ansible_host=ip of the clients //this is the configuration of clients//
save and exit (:wq!)
Now generate the ssh key in ansible server.Through ssh connection establish between the server and the clients
ssh-keygen is the command to generate ssh key in server
Now we can see id_rsa and id_rsa.pub keys in /root/.ssh

#cd .ssh/
#ssh-keygen
   id_rsa id_rsa.pub


execute the foolowing command 
ssh-copy-i root@ip of clients or ssh-copy-id (client id)
#ssh (clientid) ---control enters into the client and enter exit to come out of node

To test the connection 
 Ansible all -m ping  (response comes from node as pong)

now connection established between the server and the clients
